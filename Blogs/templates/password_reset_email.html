hi there,

someone asked for a password reset for the email address {{ email }}.
follow the link below:
{{ protocol }}://{{ domain }}{% url 'password_reset_confirm' uidb64=uid token=token %}

In case you forgot your Blogs username: {{ user.username }}

If clicking the lihk doesn't work, please copy and paste the URL
in a new browser Window instead.

if you've received this email in error, it's likely that another user
entered your email address by mistake while trying to reset password. 
if you didn't initiate the request, you don't need to take any further 
action and can safely diregard this email.

Thanks,

The Blogs team
